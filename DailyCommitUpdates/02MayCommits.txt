Summary of the Problem: The problem involves the need for a comprehensive Travel Planning and Itinerary Management Application, known as TravelBuddy, to address the inefficiencies and challenges faced by travelers in planning and organizing trips.

There's a lack of a centralized platform, leading to manual organization of trip details and a cumbersome user experience.
