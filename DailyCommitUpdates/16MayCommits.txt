Prerequisites:
**MongoDB Installation**: Ensure that MongoDB is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [MongoDB's official site](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
**MongoDB Tools**: Make sure that MongoDB command line tools are installed, specifically `mongoimport`, which is used for importing data.
